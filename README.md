# handwriting-recognition
# Select 20 numbers from 0 to 9 and write them down on papers. Scan the images or take photos by phone, with one number per photo. It is better to have the number fill up the entire screen, so you don't bother to crop each of them. Once the images are imported into python, adjust the size of images to 8 pixels by 8 pixels with 4 bit (0-16 scale) using the code in "3. How to resize and scale a picture?" in the notebook, so that the format and size of your own images are the same as those in "Example 2" of the code notebook. Your images will be used as testing data. Then using the trained machine learning models in the notebook to recognize the numbers you wrote.
# The machine learning models should be trained by the testing data "digits" from database provided in Example 2.
# Pick up 2 or more models to test on your 20 images.
# Find the wrongly recognized numbers and propose the reason of failed recognition.
# Extra credit (1 point): Find another dataset and train your model as well as calculation of the accuracy and confusion matrix.
